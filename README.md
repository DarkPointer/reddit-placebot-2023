### Reddit place bot 2023

- [x] üëç API-less authentication
- [x] ‚ùå Worker system
- [x] ‚åõ Place pixels

## How to use
1. Put the image you would like to draw in the `images` folder in the following format: `image.bmp`
2. Run `go build .` to build the program
3. Run `./redditplacebot -minX=64 -minY=64` to run the program

## This repository still contains few bugs, for example, the bot will be able to draw, there will be no errors, but the pixel will not be draw on the canvas.
Any help is appreciated.
